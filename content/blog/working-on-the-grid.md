**Intro**

*"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life." - Steve Jobs*

^ I recently read Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson and I highly recommend it! Such an incredible and inspiring life. I put the above quote as I believe it's important to do what you want with your life and not to live based on others expectations of you or what you may think is required of you. 

Working in tech things move incredibly fast and I can attest to that in just how much things have changed for me in the past year. As we all know in 2020 the pandemic was a real shock in the beginning. On my end I Faced a lay off and I also failed at launching my own company. I am proud of everything that has happened in-between and wouldn't change a thing however. I recently left a phenomenal company (Banyan Air Service) in Fort Lauderdale back in September to join a fast growing medical software company. Banyan was a great experience and I had the pleasure of working with a bright team there. In just a little over a years time we were able to launch a mobile application for both our customers and employees to both iOs and Android app stores. 

This leads me into the subject of this post. Although I was enjoying my time at Banyan working on our products there I was reached out regarding a new software engineer position. My new company Olive AI. An artificial intelligence company that is focused on automating tasks within the health care industry. It's incredibly exciting to me how software has the potential to make such a big impact on an industry that is out dated (by means of technology) and the company is soon to have an IPO within the next year or so! 

**"The Grid"**

My new position at Olive is remote which is a change for me as my experience at other companies was always in-person. I have been there for about a month now and I thought this would make for a good blog post to list some of the things that I am enjoying about working remote or "On The Grid" as Olive likes to put it.
