### Oï»¿h My Zsh 

Iï»¿f you are not familiar with zsh in your workflow I highly recommend it. It's an open source tool for managing Zsh configuration. Using a normal Bash window some things such as autocomplete may be available out of the box which is nice but I feel like Zsh provides a lot and is nicer to use but there is some initial set up. 

Iï»¿ am more or less creating this post so that I can remind myself on how to configure this since I quite often have to set up new machines. 

### Sï»¿et up

Cï»¿lone the zsh-autocomplete plugin

```shell
sudo git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```



### Eï»¿dit the zshrc file

Nï»¿ext step is to add the plugin to the zshrc file 

```
vim ~/.zshrc

plugins = (
  // List of plugins here
  zsh-autosuggestions
)
```

Aï»¿fter restarting your terminal zsh autocomplete should be working ðŸŽ‰

Aï»¿t some point I will eventually create a github repository on machine set up for the tools I use most often but maybe these short tutorials can be helpful for quickly getting things going.
