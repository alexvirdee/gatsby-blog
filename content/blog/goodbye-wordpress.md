title: Goodbye WordPress
description: Why I switched this site over to a static development environment
  with Gatsby.js
---
## Gatsby.js

React.js is very popular among front-end developers. It allows us to create interactive web pages and applications both on the web and mobile. One of the main reasons React is powerful is through the use of its virtual DOM which enhances its performance. Re-rendering of the DOM is essentially taken care of by React. 

Gatsby.js is a static website generator built off of React. What is does is render static React components creating a blazing fast experience for users. Images and data are also optimized by GraphQL. There are initialized performance patterns, route-based code splitting, and more. 

After implementing it on this blog as well as my photography site I will definitely utilize it more often in the future as I love the development speed and fast UX. Please read further as I explain why I switched over. 

## WordPress

I am sure you may have heard of good old wordpress. It is a content management system built from PHP and has been around for many years. The main benefits of using WordPress is that literally anyone can build a website from it which is great if you do not have in-depth programming knowledge. During the beginning years of the web it took some decent coding skills to build a site. With WordPress you can install the software on a web host and get a blog going in under an hour. It really is that simple. 

This website was initially using it but after a few years I decided it was a bit too much to use and decided to code out a Gatsby website. 

## Comparison

A few years back I was still getting the basics of software development (front-end) & could only manage building small html5 games and websites. Working with Gatsby.js would have been a little too complex at the time and WordPress was easy to get up and running. I am now enjoying the development speed involved with React.js websites and will continue to move forward building in that environment. Below are some pros and cons of both Gatsby and WordPress. 

* WordPress Pros
   * Fully built CMS system (great for people not familiar with code)
   * Easily add images 
   * Drag and drop components (Navbar, footer, etc.)
   * Blog is built and ready to go
   * You can manage site from any computer 

* WordPress Cons 
   * Vulnerability. It is well known that WordPress sites are about 30% of the internet and      are a target for hackers. 
   * $$$. It can be expensive with a web host to use. 
   * Will need constant updates that can potentially break plug-ins the developer is using
   * Coding knowledge. If things break some programming knowledge will be helpful to solve issues and also fully customize a site this is necessary.
