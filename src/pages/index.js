        <p>Welcome to my blog!</p>
        <p>I am a web developer based in Miami, Fl. ðŸŒ´</p>
        <p>I studied Business Administration at the University of Central Florida & after graduating taught myself how to build software. I want to share my journey of getting into the industry without a traditional Computer Science degree & realizing fulfillment from a career in tech. I am enjoying the process of writing and getting some of my ideas and thoughts on here. I hope you may find some my posts helpful or interesting.</p>
