### We are all bound by it

Time... something we all cannot escape and it is a fundamental thing we (or at least I do) take for granted. Only 24 hours a day to make an impact on the world and it seems to just go by in an instant. Where it goes and how fast it seems to be flying is an enigma. Take for example the last blog post I made was just under a year ago even though I have been meaning to write more often specifically more technical posts and things that I am working on. 

Looking at my github commits on the source code for this site, I see I was adding some code on a small search feature a few months ago so that must mean I haven't completely abandoned the idea of writing more often. I am also realizing that this small space on the internet is mine and I can make posts as short or as long as i'd like! People may not even read anything on here but I like the idea that the things I write will be here in the future (granted if the Netlify server this site lives on doesn't shut down ðŸ˜„). I'd like to set a goal for myself that in 2023 for the amount of blog posts to write up would be at least one every other month or 6 for the year. That's a goal I think I can hit so I will focus on that. 

As the years go by I see in this industry that I am in (software engineering) just how drastically things change and that I am in for some serious life long learning. I love it but it definitely can be difficult at times to open up an IDE on the weekends and get some personal code/projects going but I realize moments of motivation will come and go which is natural and this discipline is a marathon not a race. Technologies will come and go with the passage of time and I want to continuously improve on this passion in software. 

The past few months have been a wild ride of dealing with a mass layoff at my previous organization; a company with a mission I still believe in but life moves on and I had to as well. I am grateful for finding a new opportunity only a few weeks after that whole situation. It's safe to say the tech industry is incredibly volatile from my experience but I know I have the skills that are wanted across companies and will keep on getting better at what I do.

Till the next post... (hopefully won't take me 11 months this time)
